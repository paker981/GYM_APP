# GYM_APP
Tech stack: Angular 15 + .NET 6 + PostgreSQL (practise Angular Materials)

This was the second project I did in Angular.
A project I did using Angular's built-in tools such as ReactiveForms and Angular Materials.
I focused on the validation of controls in Angular and the overall design of the application, this is a prototype of a gym registration form.
I finalized the whole thing with an API based on .NET 6 with PostresSQL.
